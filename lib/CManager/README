                                   CManager
=============================================================================

  Command Manager is a simple command interpreter designed like a pseudo-asm
syntax;

Build flags:
      -DDISABLE_EXCEPTIONS : Compile the code without validations and exception
                          handling. This is disabled by-default in minik
                          build_flags. Exception handling comes with an execution
                          overhead for checking many error cases. Also increases
                          the standard binary size. With DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS,
                          your scripts will not be checked
                          and will always be trusted. If your codes have
                          problems, this can lead to minik crash because
                          kernel will not be protected from mistakes your
                          code does on the cpu when kernel handles the
                          execution to your code.

Interrupts:
Interrupts in minik language are soft interrupts and it's not always guaranteed
that the response will be atomic OR will be catched (if it's a short signal).
As the processing might be on another task in the time of the interrupt pin
event.
On the other hand, all input pins are available for interrupts.
