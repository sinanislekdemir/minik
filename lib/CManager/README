                                   CManager
=============================================================================

  Command Manager is a simple command interpreter designed like a pseudo-asm
syntax;

Build flags:
      -DENABLE_EXCEPTIONS : Compile the code with validations and exception
                          handling. This is enabled by-default in minik
                          build_flags. This comes with a execution
                          overhead for checking many error cases. Without
                          ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS, your scripts will not be checked
                          and will always be trusted. If your codes have
                          problems, this can lead to minik crash because
                          kernel will not be protected from mistakes your
                          code does on the cpu when kernel handles the
                          execution to your code.
